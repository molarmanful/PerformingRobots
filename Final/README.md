## Context

```
OZYMANDIAS
by Percy Bysshe Shelley

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
```

The above poem is a poem by British poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It is a poem about the fall of civilizations and the irony of hubris. When I first heard this poem being read, I was strongly impacted by the orator's power in his words and the imagery evoked. As such, I decided to reimagine this poem with an alternative interpretation involving robots.

## Process

See `journal.md` for a development journal detailing the specifics of my process.

It was immediately apparent to me that the limited resources/tools I had at my disposal this time around would prove to be a daunting challenge.
