## Context

```
OZYMANDIAS
by Percy Bysshe Shelley

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
```

The above poem is a poem by British poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It is a poem about the fall of civilizations and the irony of hubris. When I first heard this poem being read, I was strongly impacted by the orator's power in his words and the imagery evoked. As such, I decided to reimagine this poem with an alternative interpretation involving robots.

## Process

See `journal.md` for a development journal detailing the specifics of my process.

It was immediately apparent to me that the limited resources/tools I had at my disposal this time around would prove to be a daunting challenge. I didn't have much material to work with besides cardboard, some modeling clay, tape, and hot glue. As a result, I soon realized that my initially ambitious vision/storyboard that I had in my head of vast deserts and stunning camerawork was not *entirely* feasible. Nevertheless, I still wanted the end result to be as dramatic and impactful as the poem was when I first heard it.

### Props

The way I went about conceptualizing the scenes, set, props, etc. was that much of the focus would be on the statue's passage through time. I figured that to create a dramatic plot progression, it would be great to have the statue "shatter" into its ruined form. Initially, I made the statue out of modeling clay, but it wasn't able to shatter at all; thus, I remade the statue out of cardboard instead. This ended up working quite nicely since I eventually made everything else -- including the set itself -- out of cardboard.

I also initially wanted to have a robot that would shoot a projectile to shatter the statue. However, it turns out that the weight/density/shape of the projectile was too unwieldy/heavy for the relatively weak DC motor that I had. After struggling with several different firing mechanisms and designs, I realized that the flinging arm from my catapult-based design also functioned perfectly as an actual arm that could topple the statue without projectiles. This was great because now, I was able to incorporate an actual robot into the poetic interpretation. I simply added wheels to the base of the robot and a button to trigger its movement/shattering actions.

### Filming

During filming, my biggest issue was camera shakiness. I wanted dynamic, "flying" shots of the statue and set as a whole; however, upon reviewing the footage, I disliked its shakiness greatly. Initially, this meant hours of re-shooting the same scene over and over again; however, I eventually took a spare Arduino and battery pack, connected a servo motor, connected my camera phone to the servo, and programmed the servo to perform the movements I wanted it to perform. This made it much easier for me to get the smooth dynamic shots that I wanted. The servo/Arduino configuration also became my figurative second robot, not necessarily present on-screen but rather behind the scenes.

The way that I filmed the set was to:

1. Have the statue among its buildings -- in the "past" -- with lights on
2. Film the robot toppling the statue
3. Take away the buildings and add some cardboard debris around the statue
4. Film shots of the ruined robot with lights off

### Editing

Lastly, during the editing phase of the project, I color-graded the scenes with the statue ruined using more blue/cold colors, and color-graded the scenes with the statue intact using more orange/hot colors. This was to visually depict the contrast between the statue's proud past state and its pitiful present state. I also decided to record my own narration of the poem and engineered the sound (layering, EQ, etc.) to give my voice a bit more presence/aptness within the context of the visuals. Underneath the narration, I included bass booms and ambient noises to bring out/warp the rhythm of the poem, as well as bring impact/drama to key points in the plot. The overall goal with the editing was not so much to cover up the limited resources, set, filming, etc. but rather to work with these shortcomings and turn them into dramatic/powerful vessels to carry the message of hubris and failure.
