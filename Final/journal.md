## Proposal

For this project, I would like to have a robot that performs/interprets Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias:

```
I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
```

I was strongly affected by [this animated interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPlSH6n37ts) of Ozymandias, but I would like to visually deviate from this animation and instead provide my own robotic interpretation. So far in my brainstorms, I want the robot to "build" the scene rather than perform within the scene outright. Likely, the robot would be the one to construct and knock down the statue, as well as interface with Processing to display background images and transition them accordingly.

For dramatic affect, I may want to have the robot "break" loudly in some way alongside the breaking of the statue. I am still unsure if I should use the previously-linked audio or record my own voiceover, but if I go with my own voiceover I will likely alter/post-process it in some way that allows a more "ominous" or "bassy" effect. I will likely use sand in some form, perhaps paired with a light fan I happen to have to simulate wind blowing.

## October 29

At this point, I've finished making the statue of Ozymandias out of clay; however, I will likely switch to cardboard since the clay is one solid piece, and I'd like the statue to "shatter" into its ruined state. I've also begun thinking about the shattering device, which will probably take the form of an automated catapult or shooting mechanism.

I remade the statue using cardboard instead of clay, using a 3 separate parts for the head, torso, and legs. It is sturdy enough to stand on its own, but also relatively easy to tip over.

## December 4

I began making the shattering device. The massive issue I've run into is that the DC motors are too weak to provide resistance to rubber bands or to carry any projectile that is able to topple the statue. I am unsure of how to proceed, so I've stopped here for now.

I've figured out a solution to yesterday's problem. Rather than a projectile-based solution, I repurposed my previously constructed catapult arm into an arm that is able to directly batter the statue. This solution is not only simpler, but allows me to be more flexible with programming and further building of the robot. I have added a button which will trigger the arm.

I added wheels to the shattering device so that it can move and act like a robot. I also created the set and filmed all of the shots I wanted. The way I approached this was to first film the shots of the statue still intact in the "past", then film the shots of the statue getting shattered, then film the shots of the ruined statue.

For the surroundings of the statue, I took spare cardboard that I had lying around and arranged them to look like buildings. I used one of the other motors and attached it to my phone to allow for smoother/more consistent panning. Even at maximum speed, the motor was barely able to move the phone, allowing for slower shots. For some shots, I instead pushed myself slowly with a longboard, opting to slow those shots down in post-processing for the intended effect.

## December 7

I edited the video, and will review it once more after waking up tomorrow.
