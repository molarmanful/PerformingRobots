For this robot performance, I decided to create a narcoleptic broken robot. I focused on basic but expressive emotes, with text dialogue to complement the "story." Most of the circuitry is left externally exposed with the exception of the OLED display and motors, which are attached by various means to the "body" of the robot.

# Problems

Initially, I had planned to have sounds accompanying the robot, but I failed to get the MP3 system to work. I instead went with a more text-based dialogue option.
